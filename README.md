**Your personal AI morning briefing.** arXiv papers, Hacker News stories, GitHub trends, weather, and optional extras are collected overnight, summarised for you, and published as your own searchable digest site.

![Linnet Hero](assets/hero.png)

After you create your own repo from this template, start with the setup wizard. It is now the main sign-in, GitHub authorization, and deployment entry point: choose the briefing shape you want, add your LLM key, and let Linnet prepare the repo handoff. The current self-hosted path uses GitHub Actions and Pages behind the scenes; you do not need to run a server or accept dashboard lock-in.

## How it works

![Linnet Workflow](assets/workflow.png)

Linnet acts like a small AI secretary for your morning routine. It checks the sources you care about, filters the noise with an LLM, and leaves you with a polished briefing before the workday starts.

## What you get every morning

| Source | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| **arXiv** | New papers matching your keywords, with AI summaries |
| **Hacker News** | High-signal AI/ML stories above your score threshold |
| **GitHub Trending** | Trending repos in your area |
| **Weather** | Today's forecast for your city |

Optional sources such as postdoc jobs and supervisor-page monitoring live behind the extension system, but most users do not need them on day one.

The setup wizard also exposes language-specific tagline extensions:

- `hitokoto` for Chinese briefings, no key required
- `quote_of_day` for English briefings, requires `API_NINJAS_KEY`

Linnet keeps the generated daily, weekly, and monthly archives in your published site, so the briefing stays searchable instead of disappearing into another feed.

## Fastest path to your own briefing

### 1. Create your own repo from this template

Use **Use this template → Create a new repository** on GitHub.

If you are just setting up your own briefing site, prefer **Use this template** over **Fork**. Forks still work, but they are more likely to hit extra GitHub friction around Actions and setup.

### 2. Install the Linnet Bridge GitHub App on that repo

Open the repo you just created, then install the **Linnet Bridge** GitHub App to that target repository.

This is the lower-friction path. It lets Linnet write files, GitHub Actions secrets, workflow settings, and GitHub Pages config for you without asking you to mint a PAT.

### 3. Open the setup wizard first

This is the main sign-in, authorization, and deployment entry point after you create your repo:

- English UI: [https://yuyangxueed.github.io/Linnet/setup/](https://yuyangxueed.github.io/Linnet/setup/)
- Chinese UI: [https://yuyangxueed.github.io/Linnet/setup/zh/](https://yuyangxueed.github.io/Linnet/setup/zh/)

You no longer need to deploy your own copy of `/setup/` first just to get started.

### 4. Fill the wizard, authorize GitHub, and deploy

At the top of the wizard:

- click **Install GitHub App** if you have not already installed it
- click **Authorize GitHub** so this browser can finish the setup flow

Then continue through the normal steps:

- briefing mode, source selection, and source detail tuning in Steps 1-2
- optional extra secrets and delivery channels in Step 3
- LLM provider, API key, model choices, and theme controls in Step 4

In Step 5, choose your target repository and click **Deploy to GitHub**.

The default one-click path uses the Linnet Bridge GitHub App flow, not a PAT. Behind the scenes, a successful deploy will:

- write the generated config files in a single commit
- create or update the needed GitHub Actions secrets
- enable `daily.yml`, `weekly.yml`, `monthly.yml`, and `pages.yml`
- configure GitHub Pages for workflow-based publishing
- trigger the first `Daily Digest` run

### 5. Run the first workflow

Most users should not need to click anything else after Step 5. Watch these two workflows in your repo:

- **Daily Digest** — generates the first issue and commits the published data
- **Deploy Astro Site to GitHub Pages** — builds the site and publishes it

Your site should go live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` a few minutes later.

Once that URL is live, put it in the repository's **About -> Website** field. That makes the site entrance easy to find directly from the GitHub repo header.

GitHub Pages provisioning can lag slightly behind the API call on a brand-new repo, so give it a short moment before assuming it failed. If repo or org policy blocks app installation, Actions, or Pages, fall back to the [manual config guide](dev_docs/manual-config.md).

## Config mental model

The repo stays simple if you remember four things:

1. `enabled: true/false` turns each source or sink on and off.
2. `display_order` controls the section order in the final digest.
3. `llm.provider`, `llm.base_url`, `llm.api_key_env`, and the two model IDs define how LLM calls are made.
4. Detailed per-source settings live in `config/extensions/<name>.yaml`.

Minimal example:

```yaml
display_order:
  - weather
  - arxiv
  - github_trending
  - hacker_news

weather:
  enabled: true

arxiv:
  enabled: true

github_trending:
  enabled: true

hacker_news:
  enabled: true

language: "en"

llm:
  provider: "openrouter"
  scoring_model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025"
  summarization_model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025"
  base_url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
  api_key_env: "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
```

If you want to hand-edit everything, start from [`dev_docs/manual-config.md`](dev_docs/manual-config.md).

## Advanced paths

### Extensions

- Built-in source plugins live in [`extensions/`](extensions/)
- Shared conventions live in [`extensions/README.md`](extensions/README.md)
- New extensions can start from [`extensions/_template/`](extensions/_template/)

### Sinks

- The website is the default output
- Optional delivery channels live in [`sinks/`](sinks/)
- Shared sink conventions live in [`sinks/README.md`](sinks/README.md)
- Secrets stay in GitHub Secrets or environment variables, not committed YAML

Example:

```yaml
sinks:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    max_papers: 5
    max_hn: 3
    max_github: 3
```

### Schedules and timezones

- [`.github/workflows/daily.yml`](.github/workflows/daily.yml)
- [`.github/workflows/weekly.yml`](.github/workflows/weekly.yml)
- [`.github/workflows/monthly.yml`](.github/workflows/monthly.yml)

GitHub Actions cron uses UTC. Edit those cron lines directly in your repo if you want different times.

python main.py --mode daily
python main.py --dry-run
python main.py --mode weekly
